When I was in elementary school, I couldn't pronounce my Rs or Ss. It was adorable. This required me to receive speech therapy two to three times per week.

Despite adults repeatedly telling me speech therapy was by no means a punishment, I was not convinced. To me, these sessions were 45-minutes inside a windowless room- time that took me away from art, music, and gym class. I would return to my classmates and hear about an epic moment, or inside joke, I missed out on. Although I received candy for each milestone in speech therapy, I couldn't shake the feeling of being "othered", and that *the longer it took me to become normal, the longer I'd be a social outcast*.

In retrospect, I'm obviously thankful for my time in speech therapy. But, what's remarkable to me now is I felt "left behind" by only a simple language impairment- I cannot imagine how those with [Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD)](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/idds/conditioninfo) or [Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/autism) feel. We've learned that [nearly 40% of youth with an ASD never get together with friends](https://arc.net/l/quote/nbrlahwv). Autistic individuals, including those with co-occurring intellectual disability, [often experience stigma, discrimination, and a sense of not fitting in with the neurotypical society](https://arc.net/l/quote/iuhkhoxg). Further, [less than one in two working age adults with an intellectual disability are currently employed or searching for work](https://arc.net/l/quote/narhxmsz). These findings highlight how feeling "left behind" as a member of society exists for a heavy portion of IDD and ASD youths and adults. I want to solve this.

**Today, I am happy to announce I will be joining the Kibu leadership team as its Head of Customer Success!** My goals are to support a product that makes the IDD community feel less left behind and immerse myself in the edtech ecosystem.

For those unaware, Kibu is both a content maker and software platform. It offers fitness, recreational, job, and life skill classes for the IDD community, plus an all-in-one software platform for Disability Providers and their employees ([DSPs](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/odep/program-areas/individuals/DSP) and Social Workers). Speaking with our CEO Daniel Caridi, I anticipate to focus mostly on the software platform side- as there is much work to be done in customer onboarding, training, support, and analytics. 

As Head of Customer Success, I recognize Kibu has a multitude of *customers* that ought to *succeed*- parents, caretakers, DSPs, Provider Admins, and so on. However, it is not lost on me that Kibu's most important participant is, and always will be, the IDD individual. As long as our strategy, product, and team are built around them and addressing the problems stated above, I am confident that all our customers will inevitably succeed.

In an act of honest vulnerability, I have two looming questions going into this job:

### 1. How does Kibu build a product for a group of people who are inherently special?

A fundamental piece of business advice is to know your customer and build a product they will love. But, how does one do that in the disability space, when there are hundreds of diagnosed disorders, each with their own varying spectrums? You can't. I'm concerned that no matter how much content we produce, there will always be a generous population underserved. To solve this, Kibu must empower the persons that know each IDD individual the best- the parents, caretakers, and DSPs. This is what excites me about the Disability Provider space! Kibu has an incredible opportunity to bring modern tech trends to Providers to help these professionals help their members. This is our ball drop or opportunity to capture.

### 2. Do I have enough experience?

This one gets to me. I am a 28 year-old with five years working in tech- zero of which have been in any disability/healthcare/education space. I am concerned I will hurt Kibu's reputation by not understanding the regulations, vocabulary, or nuances of my customers. With that said, I aim for my first 100 days (and beyond) to be filled with researching, volunteering, and shadowing. I hope to use my mom, a former social worker, and my sister, a current speech pathologist, as mentors. I will shut up and listen! ðŸ˜„

Lastly, I want to thank Daniel Caridi, Ben Langley, Justin Fagella, Sam Crutchfield, and the rest of the Kibu team for believing in me so far. This marks the most major step in my career, and I couldn't have done it without you guys. Let's get to work!
